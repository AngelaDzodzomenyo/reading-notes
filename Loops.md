# Loops! There is is!!
        - quick and easy way to do something repeatedl

            + you can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X stepps in one directions, then Y steps in another
            a. ex: "Go five steps to the east"
            for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
                // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
                console.log('Walking east one step');
            }

            + there are many different kind of loops but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action soe number of times
            + The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:
            a. for statement
            b. do...while statement
            c. while statement
            d. labeled statement
            e. break statement
            f. continue statement
            g. for...in statement
            h. for...of statement

    1. for statement
            - repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
                ex. for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]) statement

    2. while statement
            - executes it statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 
                ex. while (condition) statement
            - if the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes the staatement following the loop
