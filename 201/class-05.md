  * CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box

### Compression
  * Text, image and videos are compressed to reduce the size of data and to ensure faster tranmission

  **Two Types of Compression**

    1. lossless
      * you can reconstruct back to the original bc nothing was lost during compression
      
    2. lossy
      * cannot do the same here bc data loss is irreversable
