# What Google Learned About Teams


## Summation
------------
> **A lot of employers are starting to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers isn't enough. A lot of work these days are becoming reliant on team-based output. This is supported by studies that show people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. Silicon Valley takes studies like that and adopts it into the workplace where companies encourage their software engineers to work together because these same studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.** 

> **In the last decade Google has focused on building the perfect team. Google created Project Aristotle to find the answer to questions about what made the perfect team. Was it common interests? Shared goals? Similar backgrounds? Personalities? A lot of research became directed toward group culture norms as this seemed to point toward instances where groups described aspects of their team in regards to "unspoken rules" or "team culture". Researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the "good" teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right ones could raise a groups collective intelligence.**
