            < li >steak </ li >
            < li >chesse </ li >
            < li > bread </ li >
          </ol >

    > looks like: 
                  1. steak
                  2. cheese
                  3. bread

            < li >steak </ li >
            < li >chesse </ li >
            < li > bread </ li >
          </ ul >
--------------------------------------------------------
    > looks like : 
                  * steak
                  * cheese
                  * bread  

  ## Definition Lists
    * < dl > usually paired with < dt > and  < dd >
        < dt >steak</ dt>

# JAVASCRIPT 
  ## Arrays
  * **Definition** : a special type of variable. It does't just store one value, it stores a list of values.

  ## How an array is used?
  
  * consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. 

  ## How is an array created?

  * **Array Literal** : prefered method
  * **Array Constructor** : uses the new keyword *Array();
  
  ## Values in Arrays

  > **!QUICK FACT!** > Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. **It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts with zero (NOT ONE)**

## LOOPS 
  ### IF...ELSE STATEMENTS
  * checks a condition
  * If resolves to true, first code block is executed
  * If the condtion resolves to false the second code blockis run instead

  ### SWITCH STATEMENTS
  * starts with a variable called the switch value
  * each case tells a possible value for the cariable and the code that should run if the variable matchs that value.
