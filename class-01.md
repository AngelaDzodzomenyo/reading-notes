# Extra Markup 
  > since the beginning of the web, there have been several different versions of HTML

<! --  -- > if you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters

< meta > - lives inside the < head > element and contains information about that web page 
         - it is not visible to users
         - empty element so no closing tag

 # HTML 5 LAYOUT
  > no longer using < div > and a class or id attribute to indicate the role of different structures on the webpage
