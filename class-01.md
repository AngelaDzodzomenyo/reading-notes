HTML STRUCTURES
 (Links to an external site.)Definitions
* elements: characters that live inside angled brackets 
* tags: opening and closing tag
 (Links to an external site.)Examples of Code
* <html></html> - anything between is code
* <body></body> - between here should be shown inside the main browser
* <h1></h1> - main heading
* <p></p> - text appears between here
 (Links to an external site.)Attributes
. provides additonal info about the contents of an element
    > ex. < p lang = "en-us" >Paragraph in English</P>
 (Links to an external site.)Content Manager Systeem
. rarely see the <html>, <head>, or <body> elements

* Advantages? Great for people who don't know how to write web pages. Some allow you to edit template files

# Extra Markup 
  > since the beginning of the web, there have been several different versions of HTML

<! --  -- > if you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters

< meta > - lives inside the < head > element and contains information about that web page 
         - it is not visible to users
         - empty element so no closing tag

 # **KEY LOOP CONCEPTS**
  1. Keywords
    a. break - causes the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside the loop
    b. continue - tells the interpreter to stopthe current iteration, and then update and check the condition again

  2. Loops and Arrays
    a. once the loop has run the right number of times, the loop stops

  3. Performance Issues
    a. infinite loop - if the condition never returns false

  **FOR LOOPS**
    1. often used to loop through the items in an array
    2. use if you know how many times you want to run code 

  **WHILE LOOPS**
    1. don't know how many time the code should run
    2. will run as long as the condition is true
