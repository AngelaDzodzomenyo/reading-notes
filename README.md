## Hello my name is Angela and this is my [GitHub](https://github.com/AngelaDzodzomenyo)

## *Growth Mindset* to me means that one might consider every challenge a lesson and opportunity to gain more knowledge and become a better version of yourself. It means rising to the occasion, stepping out of your comfort zone and never being afraid to seek help, ask for clarification and being open to critique. Don't be araid to fail. That just means you get to be more creative. 
--------------------------------------------------------
### Somethings that will keep me in a Growth mindset?
  * Being an active listener
  * Openness to change 
  * Holding myself accountable
  * Adapting to what comes my way
