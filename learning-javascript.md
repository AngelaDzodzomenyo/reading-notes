# Javascript Reading Notes
-----------------------------------------------------
## Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript
    * Standards for Javascript are the ECMAScript Language Specification(ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization APL Specification(ECMA-402)

    > Javascript and Java Programming Language are not the same thing.
        * They are both trademarks of Oracle
    
## Functions
    - Three Ways to Declare a Javascript Variance
        *using var
        *using let
        *using const

## Variables
    - c ontainers for storing data **values**
    > ex. x,y,z are variables, declared with the *var* keyword
    > ex. var x = 5, var y = 6, var z = x+y
        * This means x stores the value **5**, y stores the value **6**, z..

    **REMEMBER** Javascript variables are containers for storing data values

## Identifiers
    - all JS variables must be identified with unique names
    - these unique names are called identifiers
    - they can be short names (like x & y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, total, volume)
