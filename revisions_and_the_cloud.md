## WHAT IS GIT?
  
  **Definitions**
  >Snapshots - data saved in a filing system of *snapshots* of work when changes are saved(commit)
  >
  >Local Operations - works using local resources so time isn't wasted on retriving info from external server and work can be done offline
  >
  >Tracking Changes - every single change applied is tracked so easier to track down corruption or mistakes
  >
  >Loss of Data - virtually impossible since at any moment you can retrieve earlier work free of damage or loss
  >
  >States -
