## Structural Markup
1. Structural Markup - the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
  * Headings (6 levels of headings)
    > < h1 >< /h1 >
  * Paragraphs
    > < p >< /p >
  * Bold & Italic
    > < b >< /b > - for bold

    > < i >< /i > - italic
  * Superscript & Subscript
    > < sup >< /sup >  - superscript (raises mathematical # to a power)

    > < sub >< /sub > - subscript (footnotes or chemical formula)
  * White Space
    > makes the code easier to read
  * Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules
    > < br /> - if you want to add line break in the middle of a paragrph or sentence

    > < hr /> - to create a break between themes.



        **EMPTY ELEMENTS** do not have words between an opening and closing tag. Usually only have one tag.
  

## Semantic Markup
2. Semantic Markup - which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is place in a sentence. that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

  * Strong & Emphasis
    > < strong >< /strong > - defaults to bold text

    > < em >< /em > - defaults to italics
  * Quotations
     > < blackquote >< /blockquote > - used for longer quotes

    > < q >< /q > - shorter quotes
  * Abbreviations & Acronyms 
    > < abbr > - used to spell out full form of an acronym
  * Citations & Definitions
  * Author Details
  * Changes to Content


# Chapter 10 - Introducing CSS
1. CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box and the contents of that box is presented. 

## CSS rule:
  * It contains two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration**

  **Selector** - Indicates which element the rule apples to 

  **Declaration** - indicates how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled

  > ### **Declaration** - sits inside  the curly brackets and each is made up of two parts:
    
    > property and value

# **JAVASCRIPT**

# Chapter 2

## What is a Script?
  * it is a series of instructions that a computer can fofllow one-by-one. 
  * Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 

## What is a Statement?
  * They are instructions and each one starts on a new line
  * Statements should end with a semicolon(makes it easier to read/follow)
  * closing curly brackets are **not** followed by a semicolon

## What is a Variable?
  * Temporarily stored bits of information
  * information may change or vary each time a script runs

## VARIABLES - HOW TO?
  1. Declare the variable - this means giving it a name.
  
    > ex. var( is the variable keyword) quantity( is the variable name);

  2. Assign them a value - what info do you want it to store?

    > ex. quantity( variable name) = 3( variable value);

      * the ' = ' sign means assignment operator
      * until you have assigned a value to a variable, it is undefined

## Data Types
  * Numeric
  * String Data
  * Boolean Data Type


## Rules for Naming Variables
1. The name must begin with a letter, $, or an underscore. Not a number!
2. Name can contain letters, numbers, $, or an underscore. No (-) or (.)
3. **CANNOT** use keywords or reserved words.
4. All variables are case sensitive
5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that is stored in the var
6. Use camelcase if using more than one word

## Evaluating Conditions and Conditional Statements
1. An expression is evaluated, which returns a value (pg. 149)
2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation(pg. 149)
